## Language preferences

*Guidance: This involves determining language-specific preferences, such as spelling variations, punctuation rules, and date and time formats, which resonate with your target audience. — Remember, adhering closely to your audience's language preferences can significantly reduce barriers to communication and enhance their experience with the brand.*

- Use American English. However for date formats use yyyy-mm-dd and times use 24h. Distances in km, weights in lbs.
- Translations should sound as natural as possible. Borrowed words should never be used (with the exception of branded names).
- Our english speaking audience is 50% english as a first language and 50% as a second/third/professional language. We need to keep this in mind when choosing terms and phrases to avoid inappropriate or confusing translations.

## Grammar and style guidelines

*Guidance: Pinpoint rules for grammar, style, and punctuation to maintain consistency throughout all your translated content.*

- Use oxford commas, periods, and question marks. Avoid exclamations, contractions, and semi-colons.
- Use active, imperative voice where users take action. Use passive or declarative voice when informing users.
- Sentence fragments are ok on their own. Otherwise full sentences with proper business grammar.
- Divide lengthy information into multiple sentences, if needed.
- In general, use the second person (`you`) to address the user.
- Avoid using the first person (`my`, `I`) as it can create confusion about who is being addressed.

## Terminology consistency

*Create a glossary of key terms, along with their approved translations, to ensure consistent usage across all content.*

### Brand Terms (Do Not Translate)

- Onetime Secret
- OTS (when used as product abbreviation)
- Identity Plus (product name)
- Global Elite (product name)
- Custom Install (product name)

### About the Brand Name

In "Onetime Secret", "Onetime" functions as a compound adjective (also called a attributive adjective) that modifies the noun "Secret". It describes a key characteristic of the secret - that it can only be accessed once. Note the spelling choice. There are actually three common variants of this term:

- "one-time" (hyphenated)
- "one time" (two words)
- "onetime" (compound)

The hyphenated form "one-time" is considered the standard spelling when the term functions as an adjective before a noun, as in "one-time password" or "one-time code". This follows the general English rule that compound modifiers before nouns are often hyphenated.

The compound form is the canonical spelling for the brand and company name: Onetime Secret.

### Core Concepts

#### Secret Management

- **secret** (n.) - The confidential information being shared
    - Translations must maintain the context of confidentiality
    - Preferred over terms like "message" or "content"
    - Example: "Create a new secret" not "Create a new message"
- **one-time** (adj.) - Describing the single-use nature of the service
    - Must emphasize the temporary, single-use aspect
    - Hyphenated when used as adjective
    - Example: "This is a one-time secret" not "This is a single secret"
- **Onetime** (compound adj.) - Part of the brand name Onetime Secret.
    - Must not be used on its own; always paired with "Secret"
    - Example: "Onetime Secret"
- **burn** (v.) - The act of destroying a secret before it's viewed
    - Technical term for destruction of a secret message
    - Translations should maintain the permanence implied
    - Example: "The secret was burned and no longer available"

#### Security Terms

- **encryption** (n.) - The process of encoding secrets
    - Technical term that should remain consistent
    - Distinguish from "encoding" or "hashing"
    - Example: "All secrets use end-to-end encryption"
- **rate limiting** (n.) - System to prevent abuse
    - Technical term for request restriction
    - Keep hyphenation in English
    - Example: "Rate limiting prevents abuse"
- **secure**
- **private**
- **password / passphrase**
- **expiration / expiry / time-to-live**

#### User Management

- **colonel** (n.) - Administrator role
    - Project-specific term, rhymes with "kernel" which is a technical term and central component of an operating system. No other project uses this term in this way. It can be confusing even in North America.
    - Translate to the common term for an "administrator" in the context of software permissions. The account with the highest level of privileges.
    - Example: "Only colonels can access this feature" (i.e. "Only admins can access this feature").
- **plan** (n.) - Subscription level
    - Use consistently for service tiers
    - Prefer over "tier" or "level"
    - Example: "Upgrade to a premium plan"

## Formatting and layout

*Set standards for formatting, layout, and typography to maintain visual and design consistency across different languages.*

- Use consistent header styles to improve readability and content flow. For example H1 for main headings, H2, H3, etc for sub-headings
- Write headings in sentence case unless the heading is a punctuated sentence:
    - Good example: How localization drives growth for fintech firms
    - Good example: Localization made easy. Why wait?
    - Bad example: How Localization Drives Growth for Fintech Firms
    - Bad example: Localization made easy. why wait?
